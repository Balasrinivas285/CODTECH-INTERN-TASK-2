### Project: 
Tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations


### Objective:
The objective of cybersecurity is to protect computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. The objective of ethical hacking is to find and fix security weaknesses in systems before bad hackers can exploit them.


### Key activities
- **Risk Assessment and Management**: Identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential security risks to an organizationâ€™s information systems.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to understand potential points of exploitation.
- **Network Security**: Implementing measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network infrastructure.
- **Cryptography**: Using encryption techniques to protect data confidentiality and integrity.


 ### Technologies used
 -**HTML**: Defines the structure of the vulnerability scanning tool .
 -**CSS**:  Adds basic styling to make the form look clean and user-friendly.
 -**Javascript: Handles the form submission and displays simulated results. In a real application, you would replace the simulated results with actual data from a backend service.


 ### Key Insights
 -**Understanding Attack vectors**: hackers must understand common attack vectors, including phishing, malware, and social engineering, to identify vulnerabilities.
 -**Incident Response planning**: Having a well-defined incident response plan ensures quick and effective action when a security breach occurs.
 -**Importance of Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, is essential to protect it from unauthorized access.
 -**Legal and ethical Boundaries**: Ethical hackers must operate within legal and ethical boundaries, obtaining proper authorization before testing and respecting privacy.
